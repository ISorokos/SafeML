- SafeML Open Questions
	1. Why are ECDFs effective ?
	2. When are they not ?
		a. Can we check when they are not ?
		b. Can we have an uncertainty estimate ?
	3. Thresholds
		a. How much distance is too much ? Can it be systematically identified for a given application ?
		b. How much data is needed for the sampling process ? Can it be systematically... ?
	4. Are there other distance measures / approaches to be included ?
		a. Kernel Mean Embedding ?

	- Not sure about 1, 2, 4
	- #3
		- During training, bootstrap the distance and sample thresholds by starting at a small value for each and incrementing until stable
		- Verify thresholds by using them during operation, need to compare versus ground truth
			-> CARLA simulation can be used to obtain ground truth

Timeline
Target:
Identify distance and sampling thresholds using ground-truth validation from CARLA simulation
1. Setup CARLA -> 1/2 week
	-> Jan Reich, Marc Wellstein
2. Setup simple ML prediction within CARLA -> 1/2 week
	-> e.g. vehicle speed prediction
3. Setup SafeML -> < 1/2 week
4. Plan+setup experiment -> 1 week
5. Discuss results and revise -> 1 week
Total ~ 1 month
ETA Start of August

- Ioannis: collect background material on CARLA and contacts and provide to Harith
- Ioannis: discussions w/ ATMP partners -> determine what ML applications they have and how we could use SafeML there
	-> update plan accordingly if needed
