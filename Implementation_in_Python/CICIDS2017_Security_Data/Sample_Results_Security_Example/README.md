<p align="justify">Figure 2 shows a sample result of six statistical measures (one pdf-based and five cdf-based) vs. accuracy of the classifier. In this example, traditional classifiers including 'Naive Bayes','Discriminant Analysis','Classification Tree', and 'Nearest Neighbor' have been used. </p>

<p align="justify">The data for the above figure was captured over 100 experiment iterations. Each time 70% of data has been randomly extracted for testing and training and the rest has been used for accuracy estimation. If we connect red lines of each box plot we can understand how each measure can react to the accuracy change on average. In addition, this plot can show which method has less variation.</p>
