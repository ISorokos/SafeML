<p align="justify">Figure 2 shows a sample result of six statistical measures (one pdf-based and five cdf-based) vs. accuracy of the classifier. In this example, traditional classifiers including 'Naive Bayes','Discriminant Analysis','Classification Tree', and 'Nearest Neighbor' have been used. </p>

<p align="justify">The above figure has been generated over 100 times, and each time 70% of data has been randomly extracted for testing and training and the rest has been used for accuracy estimation. If we connect red lines of each box plot we can understand how each measure can react to the accuracy change on average. In addition, this plot can show which method has less variation.</p>
